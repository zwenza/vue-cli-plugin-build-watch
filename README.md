**:rocket: Start your Vue application in webpack watch-mode!**

This is a vue-cli 3.x plugin to add a build-watch script in your Vue project.

## Getting started

:warning: Make sure you have vue-cli 3.x.x:

```
vue --version
```

If you don't have a project created with vue-cli 3.x yet:

```
vue create my-new-app
```

Navigate to the newly created project folder and add the cli plugin:

```
cd my-new-app
vue add vue-cli-plugin-build-watch
```

Start your app in watch-mode:

```
npm run build-watch
```
